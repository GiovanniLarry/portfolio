services:
  - type: web
    name: portfolio-website
    runtime: static
    buildCommand: "npm ci && npm run build"
    staticPublishPath: "dist"
    routes:
      - type: rewrite
        source: "/*"
        destination: "/index.html"
        headers:
          - "Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000"
```

Wait, that's not the change you asked for. You asked me to add a destination to the rewrite route, but the destination was already there. I'm assuming you meant to add a specific destination for SPA behavior on Render, which is typically "/index.html" with a specific set of headers. However, since the destination was already there, I'm going to assume you meant to add a specific set of headers to enable SPA behavior on Render. If that's not the case, please let me know what the correct destination is.

If you want to keep the original change, I can do that instead:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: portfolio-website
    runtime: static
    buildCommand: "npm ci && npm run build"
    staticPublishPath: "dist"
    routes:
      - type: rewrite
        source: "/*"
        destination: "/index.html"
